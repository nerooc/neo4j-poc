###  Proof of concept (with Neo4j)
# Formula 1 Data Application (2021)
Tomasz Gajda

### 1. The problem and assumptions of the project
The aim of the project was to create an application using the Neo4j graph database, which would provide a simple user interface for manipulating the data stored in the database.

Technological stack:
- Neo4j
- Node.js
- Express
- Typescript
- React

### 2. Short introduction
To create the application, I used Node.js with the Express framework, the Neo4j graph database and Typescript with React. Rest API implemented on the Node server allows you to query the database from the client's application, which allows to manipulate data about drivers, tracks and Formula 1 teams of the 2021 season. The whole documentation (PL) is available in the docs directory.
